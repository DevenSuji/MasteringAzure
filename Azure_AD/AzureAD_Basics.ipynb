    "    + Since these are external identities, hence they have an external identity provider.\n",
    "    + The authentication of such users happens at the external provider, and then they are redirected to the resources they need to access in our tenant.\n",

    "## Azure AD Security  \n",
    "Although Azure AD is technically just an identity and access management system, it takes a really sophisticated, multilayered approach to security. Based on the criticality there are several barriers that we administrators can put in place before a user is allowed into the directory.  \n",
    "+ The first barrier is the user credentials.  \n",
    "+ The second barrier is Azure AD conditional access. \n",
    "    + In addition to credentials, conditional access rules can check if the device is domain joined or not.\n",
    "    + It also checks if it is the usual device and operating system that the user uses, what does the source location and IP address of the request look like, and for which application is access being requested. All these parameters are signals and analyzed and compiled into a score by Azure AD. And with every legitimate login the machine learning algorithms learn about the user's login patterns to make itself smarter. All anomalies are assigned a risk rating. High-risk sign-ins can be blocked, low-risk sign-ins are allowed, and moderate-risk sign-ins can be put through additional multi-factor authentication. \n",
    "+ Modern Multifactor Authentication is the third barrier. With MFA you can get one-time passwords through the regular channels of text message, phone call, email, and also through the Microsoft authenticator app on the phone. What's cooler is that you can altogether avoid the mess of one-time passwords.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Using conditional access and multi-factor authentication makes the whole process so much smoother. Users can now be prompted for multi-factor authentication only when required, such as when the sign-in appears to be risky as assessed by the conditional access policies. When it does not appear to be risky users can go straight into the directory after verifying their credentials.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "These were the three barriers that can be implemented before allowing users into the directory.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Azure AD Directory Roles (AAD DR)\n",
    "  \n",
    "+ This applies to users in the directory. \n",
    "+ With this you can assign different levels of administrative rights to relevant users in the organization. You already know administrator groups in Windows Server. This is its equivalent counterpart in the cloud. There's a slight difference in the naming convention though. For example, global administrator in Azure AD is roughly the same as an Enterprise administrator in Windows Server Active Directory, but the concept is fundamentally the same.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Azure AD Identity Protection (AAD IP)\n",
    "  \n",
    "+ This feature gives comprehensive insight into the status of your identity infrastructure in the cloud. \n",
    "+ It has the ability to flag users for risk, discover irregular access events, identify potential shortcomings in security, give suggestions on how to fix those shortcomings, and recommend actions that you can take to mitigate the risk associated with the flagged users.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "All the features before identity protection were precautionary to ensure nothing bad happens, but identity protection is a serviceable feature. Basically, it's for monitoring and reporting.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "After the precautionary and serviceable features we have tools for identity governance.  \n",
    "These help establish a proper procedure for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of user identities in the organization. You can use this to streamline processes in identity and access management that may not be wrong, but probably have a room to improve based on the best practices in the industry.  \n",
    "There are three tools in the identity governance toolbox.  \n",
    "+ Privileged Identity Management (PIM):\n",
    "    + PIM takes the principle of least privilege and adds the time dimension to it. The principle teaches us that a user must only be given just enough permissions required to do their job, not more, not less. But even the minimum privilege assigned to the user may not always be in use, so with PIM you can enable just in time elevation of privilege for eligible users on request. Think of it as scaling up and down, but instead of resources you're scaling the permissions up and down based on the requirement.  \n",
    "+ Entitlement Management (EM):\n",
    "    + This allows your end users to be more informed about what resources they have access to or can request access to. Accessing resources has always kind of been a hit or miss game for end users. Try to access a resource, if you can't then call the help desk. Sometimes users are unaware that they have access to certain resources. EM aims to change that by allowing users to discover and request access to groups, applications, and resources in the form of packages that they are eligible for. \n",
    "+ Azure AD access reviews:\n",
    "    + This nicely rounds up all the configurations we make in the previously mentioned tools. It enables us to periodically review the access that has been assigned to users, re-certify it if the access is still required, or revoke it if it isn't. You can also run regular audit checks where you can add a justification on why a user requires specific access."
