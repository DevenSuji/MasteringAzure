    "## What is Azure Batch?\n",
    "Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready to run a job, Batch does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Starts a pool of compute VMs for you.\n",
    "+ Installs applications and staging data.\n",
    "+ Runs jobs with as many tasks as you have.\n",
    "+ Identifies failures.\n",
    "+ Requeues work.\n",
    "+ Scales down the pool as work completes.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There might be situations in which you need raw computing power or supercomputer-level compute power. Azure provides these capabilities."
